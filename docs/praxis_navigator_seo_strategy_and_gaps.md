# Praxis Navigator — SEO Audit & Content Strategy
**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Objective:** Drive qualified traffic → **free trial signups** (demo requests secondary).

---

## 1) Audit Findings (Current Weaknesses & Gaps)

### 1.1 Sitewide Content Gaps (Missing or Underdeveloped)
- **Use‑case/Solution pages:** No short, problem-led pages (e.g., *Phishing Risk Monitoring*, *Audit‑Ready Culture Evidence*, *Manager Dashboards*) to capture specific, high-intent searches and give skimmable value.
- **Competitor comparison pages:** No “**Praxis vs KnowBe4**” or “**Praxis vs Junglemap/Nimblr**” pages to win late-funnel searches and position differentiation.
- **Customer proof:** Case studies/testimonials/logos are thin or scattered. No **Case Studies hub** with in-depth stories and outcomes.
- **FAQ (sitewide + inline):** Common objections (privacy, M365 permissions, deployment, pricing) aren’t consolidated into a simple, crawlable FAQ.
- **Security/Trust surfacing:** Deep compliance content exists but is hard to find or too dense for first-touch. Needs a concise **Trust** overview with links to detail.
- **Resources layer:** Blog/whitepapers are not yet live, reducing awareness-stage capture and internal-link “authority” building.

### 1.2 Segment Pages — Depth & Persuasion
- **CISO page** is the most complete; other persona pages (**Executives/Boards, Department Managers, SAT/HRM**) are **incomplete** (sections stubbed or thin).
- Pages don’t yet **fully speak the persona’s language** (exec/business outcomes vs technical depth vs program/learning outcomes).
- Missing **role-differentiated CTAs** (e.g., “Executive Briefing” vs “Start Free Trial” vs “See Team Benchmark”).

### 1.3 Buyer Journey Coverage
- **Awareness**: Minimal education content (guides, POVs, research summaries) to attract early-stage queries (e.g., *“measure security culture,” “prove SAT ROI”*).
- **Consideration**: Light on **ROI calculators**, benchmark downloads, and **how‑it‑works** explainers to remove friction.
- **Decision**: No **comparison pages**, limited **case studies**, and no **trial onboarding explainer** before Azure Marketplace handoff.
- **Conversion**: CTAs exist but are **inconsistent** in density and placement; several long pages end without a compelling next step.

### 1.4 Messaging & Clarity
- The core promise (measure real security behaviors, not vanity SAT metrics) is strong but **definition of product** can be crisper at first touch (e.g., “Security culture analytics for Microsoft 365”).
- Compliance/technical depth can **overwhelm** early readers; needs summarised **Trust** highlights with a link to full details.
- Persona pages should **translate the value**: Execs (risk/ROI/oversight), CISOs (metrics/integration/defensibility), Managers (team performance/coaching), SAT (program effectiveness/continuous improvement).

### 1.5 Conversion Funnel & Signup Flow
- **Primary CTAs** (“Start Free Trial”, “Request Demo”) are present but not **contextualised** by persona; limited **mid‑page** and **end‑of‑page** CTAs.
- **Azure Marketplace** handoff may feel abrupt; lacks an intermediate **“Start Trial” explainer** that sets expectations (steps, permissions, time to deploy).
- No evidence of **micro‑conversions** (ROI calc download, benchmark report, sample board pack) to capture leads not yet trial‑ready.

## 2) Recommended Content Strategy & Page Map

### 2.1 Quick Wins (2–4 weeks)
1) **Finish persona pages** with role‑specific outcomes, proof, and tailored CTAs.  
2) Launch **Start Trial explainer** page (pre‑Azure) outlining steps, requirements, and support.  
3) Publish **2 comparison pages** (KnowBe4, Junglemap/Nimblr) + a **Case Studies hub** with at least one flagship story.  

### 2.2 Strengthen Existing Pages
**Product / Platform Overview**  
- Add a one‑liner definition: *“Praxis Navigator is a security culture analytics platform that continuously measures real‑world behaviors via Microsoft 365.”*  
- Restructure into **Benefits → How it Works → Proof → CTA**.  
- Add **diagram**: where Praxis sits (M365/Graph in, dashboards/reports out).  
- End with **Start Free Trial** + “See a Sample Report” secondary CTA.

**Features**  
- Convert features into **benefit‑led modules** (e.g., *Continuous Behavior Monitoring → “Know if habits are improving—weekly.”*).  
- Each module: short paragraph + 3 bullets + micro‑screenshot.  
- End with **Try it Now** CTA.

**Integrations**  
- Focus on **Microsoft 365** first; add “coming next” strip for SIEM/SSO.  
- Simple **architecture tile** + 5 FAQs (permissions, data, setup time, SSO, support).

**Security/Trust**

- Link to deep **Compliance Hub** for auditors.

- Make **trial and demo** the default end to every journey.  
- Treat persona pages as mini‑homepages for their audience—each must persuade on its own.  
- Publish comparison pages and at least one flagship case study **before** you scale top‑of‑funnel content.
