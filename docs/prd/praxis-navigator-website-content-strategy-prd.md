**Project Type:** Website Content Strategy & Conversion Optimization

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview
The Praxis Navigator Website Content Strategy Implementation is a comprehensive website transformation project designed to convert current content gaps into competitive advantages through strategic content architecture and conversion optimization. This initiative will establish Praxis Navigator as the authoritative bridge solution connecting SAT (Security Awareness Training), HRM (Human Risk Management), analytics, and compliance markets.

### Business Context
Currently, the website has significant content gaps, incomplete persona pages, weak conversion funnels, and missed opportunities to capture high-intent searches across three converging markets. This results in suboptimal trial conversion rates starting from a baseline of zero signups.

### Primary Objective
Drive qualified traffic to free trial signups (with demo requests as secondary conversion) by transforming Praxis Navigator from a niche analytics tool into the market-leading "missing link" solution for security culture measurement.

### Expected Business Impact
- **18-month target:** 75 trial signups per month
- **Revenue pipeline:** $650K qualified pipeline from website-driven trials
- **Market positioning:** #1 ranking for "security training effectiveness" (3,600/month search volume)
- **Partner channel:** 30% of trials coming through Microsoft partner network

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis

**Content Architecture Problems:**
- **Incomplete persona coverage:** Only CISO page is fully developed; Executive/Board, Department Managers, and SAT/HRM pages are incomplete or stubbed
- **Missing competitive positioning:** No comparison pages against key competitors (KnowBe4, Junglemap/Nimblr) to capture late-funnel decision searches
- **Weak social proof:** Scattered testimonials, no centralized case studies hub, thin customer evidence
- **Trust barrier:** Deep compliance content exists but is buried and overwhelming for first-time visitors

**Conversion Funnel Gaps:**
- **Awareness stage:** Minimal educational content to capture early-stage searches like "measure security culture" or "prove SAT ROI"
- **Consideration stage:** Missing ROI calculators, benchmark downloads, how-it-works explainers
- **Decision stage:** No trial onboarding explainer before Azure Marketplace handoff, creating friction
- **Conversion optimization:** Inconsistent CTA placement, generic rather than persona-specific calls-to-action

**Market Positioning Confusion:**
- Product definition lacks clarity at first touch ("Security culture analytics for Microsoft 365" not immediately clear)
- Multi-market opportunity not leveraged (SAT/HRM evolution, analytics market, executive reporting needs)
- Messaging doesn't translate value appropriately across personas (technical vs. business outcomes)

### Impact Quantification
- **Search opportunity loss:** Missing high-intent keywords with significant search volume
- **Conversion impact:** Visitors bouncing due to unclear value proposition
- **Competitive disadvantage:** KnowBe4 dominates SAT searches despite measurement gap weakness
