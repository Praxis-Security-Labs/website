## Background Context

Praxis Navigator addresses the critical measurement gap in security awareness training effectiveness, building on over 25 years of pioneering work in security culture research and behavioral analytics by founder Kai Roer. While organizations invest heavily in Security Awareness Training (SAT) and phishing assessments, they cannot measure whether these investments translate to improved real-world security behaviors. Our Microsoft Graph API-based solution provides continuous behavioral monitoring without workflow disruption, filling this blind spot for SMB and Enterprise markets.

The promotional website serves as the primary conversion vehicle for trial users, leveraging Kai Roer's unparalleled authority as the world's leading expert in security culture. Beyond co-authoring "The Security Culture Playbook" with Perry Carpenter (Wiley, 2022), Kai brings an unprecedented portfolio: creator of the open-source Security Culture Framework (adopted by ENISA for EU-wide guidelines), author of multiple cybersecurity books including "Build a Security Culture" (2015), founder of CLTRe (the world's first security culture SaaS company acquired by KnowBe4), and Chief Research Officer at KnowBe4 where he led groundbreaking research on human cyber risk. His peer-reviewed academic research, Ron Knode Service Award from Cloud Security Alliance, and Fellowship at the National Cybersecurity Institute establish credibility that no traditional security vendor can match.

With regulatory frameworks like NIS2 requiring executive accountability and cyber insurance increasingly scrutinizing training effectiveness, organizations urgently need behavioral evidence that current tools cannot provide. Kai Roer's research-backed approach to security culture transformation, validated through decades of academic collaboration and enterprise implementation, provides the credible foundation that enterprises require for this critical investment. Praxis Navigator represents the next evolution of Kai's pioneering work - moving from measuring security culture to continuously monitoring actual security behaviors.
