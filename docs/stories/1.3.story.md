## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**[Source: Story 1.1 - Approved, Story 1.2 - Approved]**
- Astro project initialized with TypeScript strict mode at `/apps/website/`
- Praxis design system integration configured via Tailwind CSS theme
- Component structure established: `src/components/` with subdirectories
- Build process configured for production deployment
- Environment variables setup for Azure integration completed

### Frontend Component Architecture
**[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]**
- **Layout Components Location**: `src/components/layout/` for Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, Navigation.tsx
- **Layout Templates**: `src/layouts/` for Astro layout files (.astro)
- **Page Organization**: `src/pages/` for route-based pages including 404.astro
- **Component Template**: TypeScript React components with Praxis CSS classes only
- **State Management**: Zustand for UI state (language, navigation state)

### Navigation Structure Requirements
**[Source: ux/site-architecture-user-flow-diagrams.md]**
Primary navigation structure:
- **Product Overview** (Product dropdown)
- **For Your Role** (Segments dropdown) 
- **About Kai Roer** (About link)
- **Resources** (Resources dropdown)
- **Pricing & Trial** (Pricing link)
- **Contact & Demo** (Contact link)

**Header Elements**:
- Praxis logo (left)
- Primary navigation (center)
- Language switcher NO|EN (right)
- Login button (right)
- Azure Marketplace button (right)

### Responsive Design Requirements
**[Source: epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md + ux/detailed-page-wireframes.md]**
- **Mobile-first approach**: Design starts from mobile (<768px)
- **Breakpoints**: 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1440px (large desktop)
- **Navigation Pattern**: Mobile hamburger menu, desktop horizontal navigation
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile touch interactions

### Praxis Design System Requirements
**[Source: architecture/design-system-governance.md]**
- **CRITICAL**: Only use Praxis CSS classes, no custom styling
- **Forbidden**: No inline styles, no custom CSS classes
- **Required**: Use Praxis design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- **Component Colors**: 
  - Header: `praxis-dark-blue` background
  - Logo/text: `praxis-white` or `praxis-gold`
  - Links: `praxis-blue` with `praxis-sky` hover states
  - Footer: `praxis-brown` or `praxis-tan` background

### Accessibility Requirements
**[Source: ux/accessibility-performance-guidelines.md]**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Color contrast 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order, focus management, escape key handling
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, proper heading hierarchy
- **Navigation ARIA**: `role="navigation"`, `aria-label` for navigation sections
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators, skip links for main content

### Component File Locations
**[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]**
- **Header Component**: `/apps/website/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Footer Component**: `/apps/website/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
- **Base Layout**: `/apps/website/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- **404 Page**: `/apps/website/src/pages/404.astro`
- **Styles**: Use Praxis CSS classes, global styles in `/apps/website/src/styles/globals.css`

### State Management for Navigation
**[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]**
- **Language State**: Zustand store for EN/NO language switching
- **Navigation State**: Mobile menu open/closed state
- **Persistent State**: Language preference across sessions
- **URL State**: Language reflected in URL structure `/[lang]/`

### Typography and Layout Standards
**[Source: praxis-design-manual/praxis-design-manual.md]**
- **Primary Colors**: `praxis-dark-blue` for headers, `praxis-gold` for accents
- **Text Hierarchy**: Proper heading structure (h1, h2, h3) with semantic meaning
- **Interactive Elements**: `praxis-blue` base, `praxis-sky` hover states
- **Card Components**: Use existing Praxis card styles for consistent layout

### Loading and Transition Requirements
**[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md + ux/accessibility-performance-guidelines.md]**
- **Loading States**: Praxis-styled loading indicators for async content
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth transitions without accessibility barriers
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals - CLS <0.1, loading indicators for perceived performance
- **Accessibility**: Loading states announced to screen readers

### Authentication Integration
**[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#authentication-flow]**
- **Login Button**: Triggers MSAL redirect to app.praxisnavigator.io
- **No Session Management**: Promotional site doesn't handle auth tokens
- **Azure Marketplace**: Opens marketplace listing in new tab
- **Environment Variables**: Uses ASTRO_PUBLIC_* variables for configuration

## Testing
**[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]**
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library tests for Header, Footer components
- **Responsive Testing**: Playwright tests across breakpoints (768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated WCAG compliance testing with axe-core
- **Navigation Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **E2E Testing**: Complete user navigation flows and page transitions

### Definition of Done - Testing Verification

- [ ] Navigation works across all responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functions properly with visible focus indicators
- [ ] Screen reader accessibility verified with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] 404 page displays helpful navigation and follows design patterns
