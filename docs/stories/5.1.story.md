## Dev Notes

### Logo Design Requirements
**[Source: Brand Guidelines + Epic 5 Requirements]**
- **Primary Logo**: Clean, professional design reflecting security and navigation themes
- **Color Variants**: Full color, monochrome white, monochrome dark

### Technical Implementation
**[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]**
