# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured Astro project with TypeScript strict mode and Praxis design system integration,  
**so that** I can develop efficiently with consistent tooling and brand alignment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Astro project initialized with TypeScript strict mode enabled and zero type errors
2. Tailwind CSS configured with Praxis CSS theme integration via @theme settings
3. ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code formatting
4. npm package manager setup with appropriate dependencies per tech stack
5. Git repository structure established with feature branch workflow
6. Development server running successfully with hot reload functionality
7. Praxis Design guidelines accessible and integrated into component development

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Create new Astro project with TypeScript template: `npm create astro@latest apps/website -- --template framework-react --typescript strict`
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json with proper compiler options
  - [ ] Set up proper module resolution and path aliases (@/components, @/utils, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify zero type errors on initial build: `npm run build`

- [ ] Task 2: Configure Praxis Design System Integration (AC: 2, 7) - **REQUIRES Task 1**
  - [ ] Install Tailwind CSS: `npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography`
  - [ ] Configure tailwind.config.js with Praxis CSS @theme settings and design tokens
  - [ ] Set up Praxis component library integration in packages/praxis-ui/
  - [ ] Create global styles file with Praxis theme imports at src/styles/globals.css
  - [ ] Verify Praxis design tokens are accessible: test with sample component

- [ ] Task 3: Setup Development Tooling (AC: 3, 6) - **REQUIRES Task 1**
  - [ ] Configure ESLint with TypeScript and React rules: install @typescript-eslint/parser
  - [ ] Setup Prettier for consistent code formatting with .prettierrc config
  - [ ] Configure ESLint + Prettier integration to avoid conflicts
  - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality using husky/lint-staged
  - [ ] Verify development server with hot reload: `npm run dev` should start successfully

- [ ] Task 4: Package Management and Dependencies (AC: 4) - **REQUIRES Task 1**
  - [ ] Configure npm as package manager per tech stack (verify package.json uses npm)
  - [ ] Install required dependencies from tech stack with exact versions specified
  - [ ] Set up workspace configuration for monorepo structure in root package.json
  - [ ] Configure package.json scripts: dev, build, preview, lint, test

- [ ] Task 5: Git Repository Structure (AC: 5) - **CAN RUN IN PARALLEL**
  - [ ] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore (node_modules, .env, dist, etc.)
  - [ ] Set up branch protection rules for main branch (require PR, status checks)
  - [ ] Configure feature branch workflow documentation in README
  - [ ] Add README with development setup instructions and commands

- [ ] Task 6: Testing Framework Setup (Testing Requirements) - **REQUIRES Task 1**
  - [ ] Install Vitest for unit testing: `npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react jsdom`
  - [ ] Install Playwright for E2E testing: `npm install -D @playwright/test`
  - [ ] Configure test file structure per testing strategy: create tests/ directories
  - [ ] Add test scripts to package.json: test, test:unit, test:e2e, test:watch
  - [ ] Create example component test to verify testing setup works

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Tech Stack Requirements
**[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript ^5.2.0 with strict mode (PRD requirement)
- **Static Site Generator**: Astro ^3.0.0 for optimal performance and SEO
- **UI Framework**: React ^18.0.0 for interactive components
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS ^3.3.0 with Praxis Design System integration
- **Package Manager**: npm ^9.0.0 (not pnpm as mentioned in AC - following tech stack)
- **Build Tool**: Vite ^4.4.0 (built into Astro)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier for consistency

### Project Structure
**[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]**
- Main application location: `apps/website/`
- Component organization: `src/components/` with subdirectories for ui, layout, sections, forms, islands
- Astro pages: `src/pages/`
- Layouts: `src/layouts/`
- Styles: `src/styles/` for CSS and styling
- TypeScript types: `src/types/`
- Utilities: `src/utils/`
- Configuration files at app root: `astro.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`

### Coding Standards
**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]**
- **Critical Rule**: Only use Praxis Design System components and styles
- **Forbidden**: No inline CSS, never use style={} attributes
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode required, all types must be properly defined
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for files (e.g., `demo-request-form.tsx`)
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase for components
- **Functions**: camelCase for function names

### Design System Governance
**[Source: architecture/design-system-governance.md]**
- **CRITICAL**: NO EXCEPTIONS - Use Praxis CSS Classes Only
- **Forbidden**: No custom CSS classes outside of Praxis theme
- **Process**: When component doesn't exist, STOP and consult Product Manager first
- **Theme Integration**: Use Praxis design tokens via @theme settings in Tailwind config

### Testing Requirements
**[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]**
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest ^0.34.0 for fast execution with Vite integration
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ^1.37.0 for cross-browser testing
- **Test Organization**: `/tests/unit/`, `/tests/integration/`, `/tests/e2e/`
- **Frontend Tests**: React Testing Library for component tests
