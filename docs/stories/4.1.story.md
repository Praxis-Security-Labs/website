## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**[Source: Stories 1.1-3.5 - Approved/Complete]**
- BaseLayout.astro already has basic i18n structure with language detection and hreflang tags
- Header component includes functional language switcher (EN/NO) with proper styling
- Privacy page demonstrates successful bilingual content implementation pattern
- 404 page shows comprehensive Norwegian localization example with proper content structure
- URL routing infrastructure partially exists with /no/ prefix support
- Zustand store setup available for persistent language preference management

### Existing i18n Infrastructure
**[Source: apps/website/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro + apps/website/src/components/layout/Header.tsx]**
- **Language Detection**: BaseLayout extracts language from URL path (isNorwegian = lang === 'no' || currentPath.startsWith('/no'))
- **Hreflang Implementation**: Already configured with x-default and alternate language links
- **Meta Tag Localization**: Norwegian defaults exist for description and keywords in BaseLayout
- **Header Language Switcher**: Functional EN/NO toggle with proper ARIA labels and styling
- **URL Structure**: Basic support for /no/ prefix routing pattern established

### Page Routing Structure
**[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md + apps/website/src/pages/]**
- **English Pages**: Located in `/src/pages/` root directory
- **Norwegian Pages**: Should follow `/src/pages/no/` pattern (partially implemented)
- **Existing Norwegian Pages**: `/src/pages/no/privacy.astro` (redirects to main privacy page with language detection)
- **Route Organization**: Mirrors English structure under `/no/` prefix
- **API Routes**: Located in `/src/pages/api/` and should support both languages
