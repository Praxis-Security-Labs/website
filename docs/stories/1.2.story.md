2. Main branch deployments automatically trigger production builds
3. Pull request preview environments created automatically for testing
4. Environment variables configured for development and production environments

  - [x] Validate CDN performance and caching behavior
  - [x] Confirm GitHub PR integration shows deployment status
  - [x] Test rollback functionality to previous deployment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**[Source: Story 1.1 - Approved]**
- Astro project successfully initialized with TypeScript strict mode at `/apps/website/`
- Build process configured with `npm run build` outputting to `dist` directory
- Environment variables structure established for Azure integration

- npm package manager configured (not pnpm as mentioned in Epic 1.2 AC#4)

### Deployment Architecture
**[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]**
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Pages with Git integration for automatic deployments
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (already configured from Story 1.1)
- **Output Directory**: `dist` (Astro default, already configured)
- **CDN/Edge**: Global Cloudflare CDN with automatic edge caching
- **Build Configuration**: Node.js version 18 required
- **Features Available**:
  - ✅ Automatic deployments on main branch push
  - ✅ Preview deployments for pull requests with unique URLs
  - ✅ Build cache for faster deployments
  - ✅ One-click rollback to previous deployments
  - ✅ Environment variables managed through dashboard
  - ✅ Real-time build monitoring and error reporting

### Environment Configuration
**[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md + development-workflow.md]**
Required environment variables for production:
```bash
ASTRO_PUBLIC_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=          # Azure AD B2B client ID for login
ASTRO_PUBLIC_AZURE_AUTHORITY=          # Azure AD authority URL
ASTRO_PUBLIC_PRAXIS_APP_URL=           # Main app URL for login redirect  
ASTRO_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_URL=          # Azure Marketplace listing URL
```

### Project Structure Alignment
**[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]**
- Main application: `/apps/website/` (established in Story 1.1)
- Build output: `/apps/website/dist/` (Astro default)
- Configuration files: `/apps/website/astro.config.mjs`, `/apps/website/package.json`
- Static assets: `/apps/website/public/` (served at root by Cloudflare)

### Performance Optimization Requirements
**[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]**
- Global CDN distribution through Cloudflare edge network
- Auto-minification for CSS, JS, and HTML files
- Brotli compression for optimal file sizes

- **Package Manager**: npm ^9.0.0 (configured in Story 1.1)
- **Node.js Version**: 18 (required for Cloudflare Pages)

### Git Integration Requirements
**[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]**
- Automatic deployment trigger on main branch push
