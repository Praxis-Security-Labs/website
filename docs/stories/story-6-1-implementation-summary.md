## Overview

Successfully implemented Story 6.1: "Enhance persona pages with persona-specific CTAs and targeted messaging" using the BMad Method AI-first development approach. This story focused on creating a reusable PersonaCTA component and integrating it across all persona hero sections.

## Implementation Details

### Core Component Created

**PersonaCTA Component (`/apps/website/src/components/ui/PersonaCTA.tsx`)**
- **Purpose:** Reusable persona-aware CTA component with analytics tracking
- **Features:**

  - Internationalization support (English/Norwegian)
  - Analytics tracking with gtag integration
  - Variant support (primary/secondary) and size options
  - Segment-specific URLs and call-to-action text

### Persona Configurations Implemented

**SAT Teams (sat-teams):**
- Primary CTA: "Start Free Trial" → `/contact?segment=sat-teams`
- Secondary CTA: "See Research Hub" → `/resources/research-hub`
- Conversion target: 6% (highest expected conversion rate)

**Security Leaders (security-leaders):**
- Primary CTA: "Request CISO Demo" → `/contact?segment=security-leaders`

- Conversion target: 4% (demo-focused approach)

**Executives (executives):**
- Primary CTA: "Request Executive Demo" → `/contact?segment=executives`
- Secondary CTA: "View Sample Board Report" → `/resources/board-reports`
- Conversion target: 3% (high-value prospects)

**Managers (managers):**
- Primary CTA: "Request Manager Demo" → `/contact?segment=managers`
