# Project Brief: Praxis Navigator Security SaaS Website

## Executive Summary

Our security SaaS solution addresses the critical gap in behavioral security monitoring by leveraging existing Microsoft Graph API data to identify, monitor, and improve employee security behaviors without disrupting their workflow. Unlike traditional Security Awareness Training (SAT) and phishing assessment platforms that only measure employee performance during controlled training scenarios, our platform provides continuous insight into actual day-to-day security behaviors that directly impact organizational security posture. Targeting SMB and Enterprise markets worldwide, we solve the fundamental problem that companies investing in SAT and phishing assessments still cannot effectively document whether their training translates to improved real-world security behaviors, leaving the actual behavior change unmeasured and security gaps unidentified.

## Problem Statement

**Current State and Pain Points:**
Organizations worldwide invest heavily in Security Awareness Training (SAT) and phishing assessment platforms, with Gartner reporting security awareness spending ranging from $15-45 per employee annually¹. Despite these investments, security incidents caused by human error continue to account for 95% of successful cyberattacks, as documented in "The Security Culture Playbook" by Kai Roer and Perry Carpenter (Wiley, 2022)². The fundamental issue is a measurement gap: companies can track training completion rates and phishing simulation performance, but have no visibility into whether these training investments translate to improved security behaviors in employees' daily work routines.

**Impact of the Problem:**
- **Financial Impact:** Organizations waste millions on security training without measurable behavior change
- **Security Risk:** Undetected risky behaviors continue unchecked in real work environments  
- **Compliance Gap:** Inability to demonstrate actual security improvement for regulatory requirements (NIS2, SOX, etc.)
- **Resource Waste:** Security teams spend countless hours on ineffective training programs without data-driven optimization

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current SAT and phishing platforms operate in isolation from actual work behaviors. Microsoft E5's built-in assessments generate data that's difficult to analyze and act upon. Traditional security monitoring tools focus on technical threats rather than human behavioral patterns. The result is a blind spot where organizations know their training scores but remain ignorant of real-world security behavior patterns.

**Urgency and Importance:**
With regulatory frameworks like NIS2 requiring executive accountability for security governance and cyber insurance increasingly scrutinizing security training effectiveness, organizations need immediate visibility into actual security behavior change. The cost of a single successful phishing attack (average $4.45M according to IBM's 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report³) far exceeds any reasonable security training investment, making behavioral monitoring an urgent business imperative.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept and Approach:**
Our platform leverages Microsoft Graph API to continuously monitor and analyze actual employee security behaviors within their existing Microsoft 365 workflows. By examining email patterns, file sharing activities, authentication events, and collaboration behaviors, we create a comprehensive behavioral security profile for each user and organization without requiring additional software installations or workflow disruptions.

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:**
- **Passive Monitoring:** No agents, pop-ups, or workflow interruptions - uses existing data streams
- **Continuous Assessment:** 24/7 behavioral monitoring vs. periodic training assessments  
- **Contextual Analysis:** Real work patterns vs. artificial testing scenarios
- **Actionable Intelligence:** Specific behavior change recommendations tied to actual risk patterns
- **Integration-First:** Enhances existing SAT/phishing programs rather than replacing them
- **Executive Reporting:** Board-ready security governance reports for regulatory compliance

**Why This Solution Will Succeed Where Others Haven't:**
Traditional security tools either disrupt productivity (agent-based monitoring) or provide incomplete pictures (assessment-only platforms). Our approach succeeds because it:
1. **Leverages Existing Infrastructure:** Microsoft Graph API is already available in most enterprise environments
2. **Provides Missing Context:** Bridges the gap between training completion and actual behavior change
3. **Delivers Immediate ROI:** Makes existing security training investments measurably effective
4. **Addresses Regulatory Needs:** Provides the behavioral evidence required for NIS2 and similar compliance frameworks

**High-Level Vision for the Product:**
A comprehensive security behavior intelligence platform that transforms how organizations understand, measure, and improve their human security posture. Users will access intuitive dashboards showing real-time security behavior trends, receive automated alerts for risky patterns, and get specific recommendations for targeted training interventions - all while seamlessly integrating with their existing security stack.
