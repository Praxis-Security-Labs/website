*This document is in progress and will be updated as research continues.*

## Executive Summary (Draft)

The Security Awareness and Training market is a mature and competitive space, with several well-established players. The market is dominated by a few key vendors, notably KnowBe4 and Proofpoint, who have significant market share. Competition is fierce, with vendors differentiating on the breadth of their content libraries, the effectiveness of their phishing simulations, and their ability to provide analytics and reporting to demonstrate a reduction in human risk.

The market is expanding beyond traditional SAT to include Human Risk Management (HRM), which aims to provide a more holistic view of human-centric risk. This includes integrating data from various security tools to identify high-risk individuals and tailor training accordingly.

Key trends include the use of AI for personalized training, a focus on creating a strong security culture, and the integration of SAT/HRM platforms with the broader security ecosystem.
